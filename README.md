I've been coding for quite sometimes from one programming language to another
programming language, from project to project. I love learning and one thing I
learned after all these times is that there is no end to what we can learn in
programming.

I've been reading the stories in #100DaysOfCode and am inspired by them. It is
amazing when people consistently do positive things in their lives. Thus, I wish
to join the challange and learn to improve my self.

There are many things that I want to learn to better myself in programming. But
I want to set some goals first so that I'm not feeling overwhelmed.

I've been learning about TDD (Test Driven Development) here and there, but never
put it into a working knowledge. So my first goal for this challange is to get a
working knowledge of TDD on React and then implement it on a side project.

There are some other things that I want to learn, but for the first week I'll
focus on this.
