# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 18 May 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a basic setup of TDD on React.

**Thoughts:** I have been making some React apps, all of them are using the
awesome create-react-app. I also have made a WordPress Gutenberg block, which is
React based, using create-guten-block. They are a very great bootstrap tools to
get a project going. But I've been wondering about the gears ticking behind the
scenes.

I found a great series about TDD on React that start from the basics of
toolings. Too bad it didn't use Webpack as I'm starting to get familiar with it.
But on second thought maybe we don't need it yet, just some basic stuff to do
testing ond React.

Got some hiccups when I setup [Cypress](http://cypress.io). I've been doing the
challange in my Windows machine and used WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). It
seems Cypress can't really work with WSL, so I need to install it on the Windows
side rather. I don't know, maybe I'll continue on my Mac next time. It took
quite sometime to get the setup working, but I think the basic setup to do TDD
is ready.
